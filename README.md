Some idea where at the start of the game, the host creates a game on chain. All other clients when they connect confirm that the number of players is correct. Perhaps they gossip somehow that they're all looking at the same object address for the game. When the game is done, they all write who won to the chain. Assuming there is a majority of honest parties, that will determine the winner. There needs to be a policy for when there isn't quorum. If the majority is dishonest, well you're just out of luck.

There could be observers. They could either be invited, or there could just be a fleet of observers + a reputation system and you can pay extra to have the observers observe and vote on the result of the game. Not sure how you'd keep the observers honest though. Maybe there is some hash you get based on the end state of the game that you have to use. Though the first honest observer could upload it and then the others just copy. Perhaps this is a use case for veiled somethings?

A game about two air traffic controllers competing somehow?

Flight attendant game?

Baggage loading game. Objective is to destroy as much baggage as possible while fitting it in?

Lovers in a dangerous space time but competitive? There is a repairing aspect? You can get out of the ship and repair from the outside? Some levels have some gravity? Different objectives besides just killing each other. Tower defence component. Light automation even. MOBA-like in that there is a getting strong phase and then a fighting phase. Fighting over objectives, buffs, etc. Towers, etc. Can look elsewhere on map, fog of war, etc.
